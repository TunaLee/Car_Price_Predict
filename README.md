# Used car price predict using by linear regression and polynomial regression


We made csv file by crawling and predict used car using by linear regression and polynomial regression.

Data was crawled on 'SK ncar', the largest used car platform in Korea.
As the largest used car market, the data is very well organized.

We organized the project with four steps.

1. Data crawling
2. Pre-processing Data
3. Rejection
4. Front-end Development
